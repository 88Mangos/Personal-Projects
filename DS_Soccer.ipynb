    "I started playing club soccer in 4th grade. I never took the sport very seriously since I played for fun, not for the dream of going pro. Yet in my 7+ years of competitive soccer, I have put in considerable time and effort into performing at my highest level for my team. However, while in games, I have noticed some odd trends I want to look at through data science. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The first trend I notice is that the team that scores the first goal often wins. This is because the team that scores the first goal was obviously good enough to score, but moreover, this first goal demoralizes the other team.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "However, there is a catch to that first observation - I noticed that when a team gets scored on before halftime, they often come out harder during the second half and make comebacks. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I will do hypothesis testing to see if the trends I notice in club soccer also occur in professional soccer. To do so, I will look at results from the 2022–2023 English Premier League Season. I specifically looked at data from the first 14 matchdays; I have not learned web scraping yet, so I had to find all the teams that scored the first goal and the minute the first goal was scored in by looking at each match's summary."

Furthermore, the games were not randomly chosen; it's the first 14 matchdays, which makes this a convenience sample. The reason why I carry out the test anyways is because the EPL 22-23 Season is a small enough population to analyze without having to use significance testing, so I will not use my data to make conclusions about the EPL 22-23 season, but rather about professional soccer games as a whole.

    "We have statistical evidence that, when a team scores the first goal, they are more likely to win if they score that first goal in the first half than in the second half.<br><br>\n",
    "It seems that, for the most part, the team that scores first early on is stronger on the day, and thus is more likely to win, whereas a team that scores first later on in the match is struggling to find the net offensively, which may also indicate overall weakness that affects their defense too."
