# Personal-Projects
Code for side projects about data science and my other passions.


If you want to run the Data Science in Soccer analysis, download DS_Soccer.ipynb and epl-2022-UTC.xlsx. Make sure to adjust the filepath in the third cell, second line of DS_Soccer.ipynb to ensure the code properly reads in the data from epl-2022-UTC.xlsx.


If you want to run the Hough Transform Jupyter Notebook, download HoughTransform.ipynb and run everything inside the notebook. There are no system-specific paths required, just an updated version of matplotlib and numpy.
